        "Explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "In everyday life, we use the decimal system (base 10), which has 10 digits (0-9). When we count past 9, we start over at 0 and add 1 to the next place (so 9 + 1 = 10).\n",
        "\n",
        "Binary works the same way, but with only two digits: 0 and 1. When you count past 1, you start over at 0 and add 1 to the next place (so 1 + 1 = 10 in binary, which is 2 in decimal).\n",

        "Analogy:\n",
        "Just like we use meters to measure length, kilograms or grams to measure mass, and liters to measure liquids, computers use bytes to measure data. Bytes are the basic measuring unit for digital information.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bits 🔹\n",
        "Bit = Binary digit (either 0 or 1)\n",
        "The smallest unit of information a computer can process\n",
        "Think of it as a single light switch that can be ON (1) or OFF (0)\n",
        "Bytes 🔸\n",
        "Byte = 8 bits grouped together\n",
        "One byte can represent 256 different combinations (2^8 = 256)\n",

        "The size of your hard drive or SSD (e.g., 256 GB, 1 TB) and your computer's RAM (e.g., 8 GB, 16 GB) are measured in bytes!\n",
        "Your internet speed (e.g., 100 Mbps) is measured in bits per second (b = bit, B = byte). 8 bits = 1 byte, so a 100 Mbps connection can download about 12.5 megabytes per second!\n",

        "The Encoding Process\n",
        "When you type text, the computer needs to convert each character into binary numbers. This process is called encoding.\n",
        "\n",
        "But here's the challenge: Which character gets which number?\n",
        "\n",
        "Different encoding systems assign different numbers to characters. It's like having different dictionaries - everyone needs to use the same dictionary to understand each other!\n",

        "Two Main Encoding Systems:\n",
        "1. ASCII (1960s - Historical Foundation)\n",
        "\n",
        "The original encoding system\n",
        "Only 128 characters (English letters, numbers, basic symbols)\n",
        "Works great for English, but can't handle other languages\n",
        "Think of it as a small dictionary with only English words\n",
        "2. UTF-8 (1990s - Modern Standard)\n",
        "\n",
        "The current global standard used everywhere\n",
        "Can handle over 1 million characters\n",
        "Includes all world languages, emojis, special symbols\n",
        "Backward compatible with ASCII (first 128 characters are identical)\n",
        "Think of it as a massive multilingual dictionary\n",
        "Why the Transition Happened:\n",
        "The Internet went global - people needed to communicate in all languages\n",
        "Emojis became popular - ASCII couldn't handle 😊 or 🚀\n",
        "International business - companies needed websites in multiple languages\n",
        "Mobile devices - people text in their native languages worldwide\n",
        "Today's Reality:\n",
        "95%+ of websites use UTF-8\n",
        "All modern programming languages (including Python) default to UTF-8\n",
        "Your smartphone uses UTF-8 for texts and apps\n",
        "Social media relies on UTF-8 for global communication\n",
        "The Key Point:\n",
        "Both systems do the same job (convert characters to numbers to binary), but UTF-8 can handle much more content. When you learn Python, you're automatically working with UTF-8!\n",
        "\n",
        "Text Encoding: From ASCII to UTF-8\n",
        "ASCII: The Foundation (1960s)\n",
        "ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) was the original encoding system:\n",
        "\n",
        "Uses 7 bits (128 possible characters)\n",

        "UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format - 8-bit) is now the global standard:\n",

        "Backward compatible with ASCII (first 128 characters are identical)\n",
        "Can represent over 1 million characters\n",
        "Handles all world languages: 中文, العربية, русский, हिंदी, 🎉\n",
        "Used by 95%+ of websites today\n",
        "How UTF-8 Works:\n",
        "Simple characters (A-Z, 0-9): Use 1 byte (same as ASCII)\n",
        "Accented characters (é, ñ): Use 2 bytes\n",
        "Asian characters (中, 日): Use 3 bytes\n",
        "Emojis (😊, 🚀): Use 4 bytes\n",
        "Example: Converting \"Hi!\" vs \"Hi! 😊\" to Binary\n",
        "\"Hi!\" (ASCII/UTF-8 - same result):\n",
        "H = 72  = 01001000\n",

        "Simple characters use 1 byte, emoji uses 4 bytes\n",
        "Computer processes all the binary data\n",
        "When displaying, computer converts back: binary → UTF-8 → characters → \"Hi! 😊\" on screen\n",
